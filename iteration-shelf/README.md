# iteration-shelf

Terminal-aesthetic review boards for in-browser design iteration. Generates two self-contained HTML files from a simple JSON manifest — a **curated shelf** for shortlisted work, and a **monster index** that safely previews every HTML artefact in a folder without frying the browser.

**Invocation:** explicit only (`/iteration-shelf` or when the user explicitly asks for one)

---

## Why

When a project spawns dozens of HTML iterations — portal variants, component explorations, layout studies — reviewing them all becomes its own problem. Eagerly embedding every iteration in an iframe crashes the browser. Opening them one at a time breaks flow. The tabs app is not a reviewer's console.

`iteration-shelf` solves that by producing two complementary artefacts:

- `_iterations.html` — **curated shelf.** Hand-picked shortlist, sectioned by concept family, all iframes eagerly loaded. Good up to ~20 items.
- `_monster-index.html` — **monster index.** Every HTML file in the target folder, grouped into segments, with on-demand iframe loading, a sticky outliner sidebar, and a warn-gate at 20+ simultaneous loads. Good for 100+ items.

Both files are static HTML. No build step, no dependencies, no external libraries. Drop them in a folder, open them in the browser, click around.

---

## Usage

### From zero

```
/iteration-shelf
```

The skill scans the current project for an `iteration-shelf.json` manifest. If it doesn't find one, it offers to generate a draft from a folder scan. Once the manifest is in hand, it generates one or both shelves.

### From an existing manifest

1. Edit `iteration-shelf.json` at the project root.
2. Run `/iteration-shelf`.
3. Both shelves are (re)generated from the manifest. Any hand-edited content in the existing shelves is diffed and flagged for confirmation before overwrite.

### What gets written

| File | When |
|---|---|
| `<target_folder>/_iterations.html` | Always, if the manifest has curated segments |
| `<target_folder>/_monster-index.html` | Always, if iteration count > 20 or explicitly requested |
| `iteration-shelf.json` | Only in init mode, at project root |

## The aesthetic

Terminal reviewer — dark, monospace, hairline-bordered. Not a portfolio. The design tokens are hard-coded:

- Background: `#0a0a0a`. Cards: `#141414`. Hairlines: `#222`.
- Mono font stack: SF Mono / Cascadia Mono / Consolas.
- Accent: `#e6c34a` (gold), `#8fc98f` (loaded-green), `#d4a017` (locked-ochre), `#e88` (danger-pink).
- Zero rounded corners beyond 2px. Zero drop shadows beyond the expand backdrop. Zero AI gradients.

The aesthetic is non-negotiable for the shelf chrome. The iterations it indexes are unconstrained.

## Manifest schema

Minimal:

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "title": "Iteration Index — My Project",
  "date": "2026-04-14",
  "target_folder": "iterations",
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": "all",
      "title": "All iterations",
      "items": [
        { "id": "v1", "file": "v1.html" },
        { "id": "v2", "file": "v2.html" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Interaction model

### Curated shelf
- Every iframe loads on page open.
- `Expand` overlays a card fullscreen. `Esc` collapses.
- `Reload` cache-busts a single iframe. `R` cache-busts all.

### Monster index
- **Placeholders only** until explicit click. `click` loads one card. `shift-click` unloads.
- **Segments** have a smart three-state button: `Load (N)` → `Unload (k/N)` (partial) → `Unload (N)` (full).
- **Sidebar outliner** with per-segment counters and scrollspy. Click to jump+load, shift-click to bulk-load a whole segment.
- **Warn-gate** at 20+ simultaneously loaded iframes.
- **Column switcher** (1× / 2× / 3×) with `localStorage` persistence and keyboard shortcuts `1` / `2` / `3`.
- `E` expand focused, `U` unload all, `R` reload loaded, `Esc` collapse.

## Integration

### With the standalone skills

These are user-level skills, installed separately (not part of any skill pack). Any of them may be absent; the shelf enforces its deliverable rules regardless.

- **`full-output-enforcement`** — mandatory. Every shelf emits complete output, no placeholders, no skeletons.
- **`design-taste-frontend`** — suppressed for the shelf chrome, free to use on the iterations themselves.
- **`high-end-visual-design`** — explicitly suppressed for the shelf. The terminal aesthetic is deliberate.
- **`redesign-existing-projects`** — if the target folder already has an index file, follow that skill's audit-first pattern before overwriting.

### With adjudant

When adjudant is active and a vault is linked, adjudant is the persistence layer. Shelf generation is appended as one line to the day's session note (`projects/{slug}/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`). New tag slugs are recorded as decisions under `projects/{slug}/decisions/{YYYY-MM-DD}-shelf-tag-{slug}.md`, using adjudant's decision schema. Without adjudant or a vault, nothing is written. The Cabinet of IMD, if active, adds chat narration only (Bostrol lines); it writes no files.

### Standalone

No standalone skills, no adjudant, no vault. Works fine. Plain HTML out.

## Browser-safety rules

Non-negotiable for the monster index — this is the whole reason it exists:

1. Never auto-load iframes. Placeholders only until user action.
2. `confirm()` prompt before bulk-loading when ≥20 iframes already live.
3. `loading="lazy"` on every injected iframe.
4. Inject iframe on load, `.remove()` on unload. Never `display:none` a live iframe (still holds memory).
5. Cache-bust reloads with `?r=${Date.now()}` so dev-mode iterations reflect instantly.

## Future variations

- **Era layout variant** (`layout: "era"`) — chronological / version-banded grouping. Planned for v0.2.
- **Theme params** — expose `--accent`, `--bg` as manifest-level tokens. Deferred until a reuse project actually needs them.
- **Multi-project aggregator** — an "all-projects shelf" that iframes each project's curated shelf inside segments. Needs vault integration; pinned for future.
- **Auto-manifest command** — `/iteration-shelf init` as a dedicated subcommand that just drafts the manifest without generating. Currently part of the main flow.

## Provenance

Extracted from the DutchBC portal project, where the pattern was born in the `_monster-index.html` at commit `54d4957`. Original spec filed by Bostrol, 2026-04-14, under explicit direction from Tom.
