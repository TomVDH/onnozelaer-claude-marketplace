# /adjudant connect

Onboard project to vault. **One rigid path — no flags, no branching, idempotent.**

## Contract flow (locked)

connect is three phases; the card in the middle is the only thing the user must read.

1. **Infer.** Run `connect.py --contract --project-root {code root} [flags]`. The JSON
   contract carries the five required fields (vault, slug, project_type, initial_status,
   purpose) with inferred values pre-filled, plus the per-agent artifact disclosure
   (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, breadcrumb, vault scaffold, .gitignore) each marked
   already-present or will-create.
2. **Confirm.** Render the contract as ONE card, both halves. Ask the user to approve or
   correct the five fields once. purpose is the one field with no inference: ask for it
   if empty; it becomes the brief's opening line and what sitrep orients from.
3. **Apply + receipt.** Run connect.py with the confirmed values (`--purpose`,
   `--initial-status`, plus the usual flags). Render `summary.receipt` back as the same
   card with per-artifact marks: created / already-present / updated. A re-run on a
   healthy project shows all already-present and writes nothing new.

Config knobs land in the breadcrumb at init with defaults visible on the card:
`cost_warn_tokens: 30000`, `stale_after_days: 30`. Existing overrides survive re-connect.

## The 5 features (locked spec)

1. **Breadcrumb** — write `.claude/adjudant` at project root containing `vault_path`, `vault_name`, `slug`, `mode`, `cost_warn_tokens`, `stale_after_days`
2. **Context files** — provision `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + `GEMINI.md` at project root from the matching templates (skip if files exist)
3. **Vault scaffold** — create `{vault}/projects/{slug}/` with `brief.md` (from `templates/project-brief-{project_type}.md`), per-`project_type` default subfolders, `_index.md` per subfolder
4. **Session note** — create today's `{vault}/projects/{slug}/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` from `templates/session.md` with frontmatter filled in
5. **Gitignore** — append `.claude/adjudant` to project `.gitignore` (create file if missing)

Also: append project row to `{vault}/projects/_index.md`.

## Inputs

`/adjudant connect` takes no arguments. Resolves everything from environment:

| Need | Resolution order |
|---|---|
| Vault path | `--vault-path` arg → `OB_VAULT` env var → `--vault-name` arg → existing breadcrumb → walk parent dirs for `Home.md` with `type: vault-home` → prompt once |
| Project slug | existing breadcrumb → cwd basename (enforce kebab-case) |
| `project_type` | existing brief → prompt once (`coding | knowledge | plugin | tinkerage`) |
| Project display name | prompt once if creating new |

## Idempotent behavior

Re-running on an already-connected project fills gaps; never overwrites user content.

- Existing `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` untouched
- Existing `brief.md` untouched
- Missing subfolders created; existing untouched
- Today's session note: if exists, no-op (the SessionStart hook handles append-on-resume separately)
- `projects/_index.md` row: updated in place, not duplicated

## Fail conditions

- Vault path can't be resolved AND user declines to provide one → exit non-zero with message
- `project_type` not provided and not promptable → exit non-zero
- Slug contains invalid characters (spaces, dots, uppercase) → exit non-zero with rename suggestion

## Per-`project_type` default subfolders

Per `reference/vault-standards.md` (single source of truth). Summary:

| project_type | default subfolders |
|---|---|
| `coding` | `decisions/`, `notes/`, `tasks/`, `references/`, `sessions/`, `images/` |
| `plugin` | coding + `releases/` |
| `knowledge` | `notes/`, `sources/`, `references/`, `sessions/` |
| `tinkerage` | `sessions/` (optional) |

Folders beyond defaults require declaration in brief's `extra_folders: []` frontmatter field.
