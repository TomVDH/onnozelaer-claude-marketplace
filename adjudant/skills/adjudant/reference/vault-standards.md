# Vault Standards

Canonical schema, naming, folder rules, and wikilink form for any Adjudant-managed vault. Single source of truth — every vault write must conform. `validate.py` enforces; `/adjudant dream` reports drift.

---

## 1. Frontmatter

Every vault file has YAML frontmatter. No exceptions except `Home.md` (which only needs `type` + `updated`).

- Standard YAML — no Obsidian-specific syntax inside frontmatter values except `project` fields (piped wikilinks).
- Dates: ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` for date-only; full ISO 8601 for timestamps.
- Strings with special characters (colons, brackets) must be quoted.
- Empty optional fields: **omit the key entirely** rather than `null` or empty string.
- Arrays use YAML list syntax, not inline `[]` (exception: empty arrays use `[]`).

### Project reference field

The `project:` field uses a piped wikilink to the brief:

```yaml
project: "[[projects/hubspot-nightly/brief|hubspot-nightly]]"
```

Always this format — not bare slug, not unpiped wikilink. Clickable in Obsidian; alias displays as the slug.

---

## 2. Tag schema (locked 2026-05-25)

**Bare tags only — no prefix.** Adjudant does not namespace its tags.

### A. File-type tags (mandatory, one per file)

`#decision`, `#session`, `#note`, `#doc`, `#project`, `#handoff`, `#index`, `#iteration`, `#release`, `#source`, `#dream-report`

`Home.md` is the lone exception — uses `type: vault-home` frontmatter, no tag.

### B. Project-specific custom file types

`#recon-item`, `#portal-concept`, `#preview`

Migrate from `cabinet/recon`, `cabinet/portal-concept`, `cabinet/preview` respectively during `/adjudant ramasse`.

### C. Topical tags (optional, queryable, sparingly)

Allowed topical clusters:

`#content/seafood-companies`, `#content/blog`, `#content/page`, `#content/hardware`, `#content/personnel`, `#content/videos`, `#content/workflows`, `#content/features`

Other topical tags allowed only if they meet all three criteria: namespaced (`category/value` form), queryable (you'd actually filter on it), used across ≥3 files.

### D. Deprecated / forbidden

- `#ob/*` (all) — replaced by bare equivalents
- `#cabinet/*` — cabinet sunset; file-type variants migrate to Bucket B, others drop
- Project-slug tags (`#dutchbc-poc`, `#hubspot-nightly`, etc.) — project membership lives in the `project:` frontmatter field
- Vague topicals: `#architecture`, `#frontend`, `#cms`, `#toolbox`, `#moc`, `#scheduler`, `#campaign-request`, `#flow-c`, `#nightly`, `#hubspot`
- Crew names: `#bostrol`, `#kevijntje`, `#henske`, `#jonasty`

### E. Project-kind classification

NOT a tag. Lives in the `project_type:` frontmatter field on the brief. Values: `coding | knowledge | plugin | tinkerage`.

### Non-tag

`cssclasses: cabinet-sidecar` in frontmatter is an Obsidian CSS class, NOT a tag. Leave untouched.

---

## 3. File-type schemas

See `templates/*.md` for the canonical frontmatter shape of every file type. Validators check actual files against templates.

### File-type list (11 + `vault-home`)

| Type | Template | Body shape |
|---|---|---|
| `project` | `project-brief-{project_type}.md` | per-type body sections |
| `decision` | `decision.md` | `## Decision` / `## Context` / `## Consequence` |
| `session` | `session.md` | intent quote + `## Log` (append-only) |
| `note` | `note.md` | free-form |
| `doc` | `doc.md` | purpose sentence + `## {Section}` |
| `handoff` | `handoff.md` | sync-managed body |
| `source` | `source.md` | `## Key Points` / `## Notes` / `## Relevance` |
| `iteration` | `iteration.md` (folder index) | a **folder** of build artefacts (HTML tryouts, experiments, superpowers); the optional `_iteration.md` is its index/manifest, read by `iteration-shelf` |
| `release` | `release.md` | `## Changes` |
| `dream-report` | `dream-report.md` | auto-populated by `/adjudant dream` |
| `index` | `_index-projects.md` or `_index-collection.md` | table or list |
| `vault-home` | `home.md` | sections per template |

### Doc vs Decision (the most common mix-up)

| If… | It's a |
|---|---|
| Filename has a date prefix | **Decision** |
| Says "what's true now / how X works" | **Doc** |
| Says "we picked X over Y because Z" | **Decision** |
| Will be rewritten as understanding evolves | **Doc** |
| Append-only history of a moment | **Decision** |
| Lives in `decisions/` subfolder | **Decision** |
| Lives at project root or in `docs/` | **Doc** |

Quick test: "When was this decided?" — clear answer = decision; "it's just how we do things" = doc.

## 4. Naming rules

| Item | Pattern | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| Project slug | lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces, no dots (`dff2026-web`) | strict |
| Brief | `brief.md` | strict |
| Decision | `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{kebab-title}.md` | strict |
| Session | `{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (one per project per day; append on resume) | strict |
| Note | `{kebab-title}.md` (no date unless time-relevant) | strict |
| Source | `{kebab-title}.md` | strict |
| Release | `v{X.Y.Z}.md` | strict |
| Iteration (folder) | `iterations/{YYYY-MM-DD}-iter-{id}-{kebab-slug}/` — holds the artefacts (HTML, etc.); optional `_iteration.md` index inside | strict |
| Dream report | `{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` | strict |
| Doc | `{NAME}.md` — **UPPERCASE** (e.g. `STANDARDS.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`) | strict |
| Handoff | `_handoff.md` | strict |
| Index | `_index.md` | strict |
| `.canvas` artefact | `{kebab-name}.canvas` | strict |
| `.base` artefact | `{kebab-name}.base` | strict |

"References" is not a distinct file type — files in `references/` subfolders use `type: doc`, `type: note`, or `type: source` based on their content shape.

---

## 5. Folder structure

### Per-`project_type` defaults

| Type | Subfolders with `_index.md` | Subfolders without `_index.md` |
|---|---|---|
| `coding` | `decisions/`, `notes/`, `tasks/`, `references/` | `sessions/`, `images/` |
| `plugin` | coding + `releases/` | `sessions/`, `images/` |
| `knowledge` | `notes/`, `sources/`, `references/` | `sessions/` |
| `tinkerage` | (none by default) | `sessions/` (optional) |

### Extensions beyond defaults

Custom subfolders must be declared in the project brief's frontmatter:

```yaml
extra_folders:
  - content-recon
  - design-iterations
  - design-system
```

Anything actually present under the project but not in (defaults ∪ `extra_folders`) is **drift** — flagged by `/adjudant dream`.

### Auto-created

- `dreams/` — created on first `/adjudant dream --save` invocation. Not in defaults.
- `canvases/`, `bases/` — created on first `/adjudant draw canvas/base` invocation if not in defaults.

### The `_index.md` rule

Every folder under a project (or at vault root) that holds ≥2 sibling `.md` files of the same conceptual type gets an `_index.md`.

**Exceptions:** `sessions/` (chronological ordering is the index), `images/`, `assets/`, `previews/`, and `iterations/` plus the iteration folders inside it (non-text / build artefacts — HTML tryouts, experiments; the optional `_iteration.md` is the only conformant file, and artefacts carry no frontmatter).

**Index shape:** `# {Collection Name}`, one-line description, `## Entries` with wikilinks. Chronological where dates are in filenames; alphabetical otherwise. `/adjudant ramasse` rebuilds these mechanically.

---

## 6. Wikilink rules

All vault-internal links use `[[note-name]]` form.

**Markdown-style links `[text](path)` are allowed if and only if `path` does NOT resolve to a vault `.md` file.** External code references, heading anchors (`#section`), and links to non-vault files are fine in markdown form.

| Context | Form |
|---|---|
| Frontmatter `project:` | `"[[projects/{slug}/brief\|{slug}]]"` (piped, always) |
| Body → brief | `[[projects/{slug}/brief\|{display}]]` |
| Body → decision | `[[projects/{slug}/decisions/{file}\|{short title}]]` |
| Body → session | `[[projects/{slug}/sessions/{date}\|{date}]]` |
| Body → source | `[[projects/{slug}/sources/{file}\|{author, year}]]` |
| Image embed | `![[image.png]]` with caption line below |

Briefs always carry `aliases: [{slug}]` so bare `[[my-project]]` resolves cleanly.

---

## 7. Content style

Body copy is **actionable, clear, unambiguous, and short**. Style is judgment, not mechanically enforced — `/adjudant dream` flags suspected style violations for human review (banned generic-AI-fluff terms, em dashes overused, three-word taglines, etc. — full list in the global voice rules, not duplicated here).
