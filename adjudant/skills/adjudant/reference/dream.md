# /adjudant dream

**Content/knowledge/memory refresh.** The third and deepest cleanup tier — semantic, not mechanical. Reads the actual prose of decisions, notes, and sessions; surfaces what's gone stale. Five-phase, judgment-heavy, human-in-the-loop. Mirrors `ramasse`'s shape on the content layer.

*Staleness is the enemy.* Dream catches "the doc says X but reality is now Y."

## What dream does (vs tidy and ramasse)

```
tidy    = surface mechanical sweep (tags, indexes, wikilink form). Routine.
ramasse = deep STRUCTURAL clean (folders, schema, file types, naming, renames). Sparing.
dream   = CONTENT/knowledge/memory refresh (semantic). THIS verb.
```

Dream operates on the **content layer**, where judgment — not regex — decides:
- **Outdated info** — decisions/notes whose content no longer reflects reality
- **Contradictions** — decision A says one thing, decision B (or a later note) says another
- **Supersession** — a newer decision overrules an older one that was never marked superseded
- **Redundancy** — multiple notes saying the same thing, ripe for consolidation
- **Stale references** — links that still resolve but point to archived/old content
- **Orphan threads** — open questions (TODO/OPEN/TBD) from old sessions, never resolved

Dream cleans semantically: mark decisions superseded, consolidate duplicates, archive stale sessions, close or re-surface orphan threads.

## Why it's LLM-judgment heavy

`dream.py` **cannot decide semantics**. Where `ramasse_scan.py` decides a structural fact ("this filename violates §4"), `dream.py` only emits *candidates* — comparators with `file · line · excerpt` — and **Claude judges**. "Decision A line 42 may conflict with decision B line 18" is a candidate; whether it's a real contradiction is a read-and-reason call, not a pattern match.

## The 5-phase shape (superpowers chain)

| Phase | Skill | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Analyse | `dream.py` + Claude | Content/staleness comparator catalog (JSON → narrative) |
| 2. Judge | Claude (judgment-heavy) | Which candidates are *real*: superseded / contradictory / redundant / stale / orphaned |
| 3. Refresh plan | `superpowers:writing-plans` → `dream-report` | Concrete refresh plan (mark superseded, consolidate dupes, archive stale sessions, close orphan threads) |
| 4. Review | (human checkpoint) | User reviews + approves plan; can edit or defer items |
| 5. Execute | `superpowers:executing-plans` | Apply with checkpoints + backups; calls `tidy.py` for any mechanical follow-up |

## Phase 1 — Run the scanner

```bash
python3 "$(dirname "$0")/../../../scripts/dream.py" \
  --project-dir "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --vault-dir "$VAULT_PATH" \
  --out /tmp/dream-scan-{slug}.json
```

Optional flags: `--today YYYY-MM-DD` (override "now" for age math — deterministic), `--stale-days N` (staleness threshold, default 180), `--include-legacy`.

The JSON catalog (the **comparator catalog**) carries ten categories:

| Key | What it surfaces |
|---|---|
| `staleness_candidates` | Content-type files older than the threshold (`updated:`/`date:`/filename date) |
| `supersession_signals` | Same-topic decision pairs, older likely superseded (+ whether already marked) |
| `contradiction_pairs` | Topically-overlapping files where a change/negation cue appears ("no longer", "switched from", "deprecated") |
| `redundancy_clusters` | Near-duplicate notes/docs by token-set (Jaccard) similarity |
| `stale_refs` | Refs that *resolve* but point to `_archive`/`_legacy` or old dated targets (broken links stay ramasse's job) |
| `orphan_questions` | Aged open-loop markers (`TODO`/`OPEN:`/`TBD`/`follow-up`) never closed |
| `orphan_threads` | Aged notes/docs with zero inbound wikilinks |
| `unacted_decisions` | `status: active` decisions whose stated `## Consequence` shows no action (unreferenced by any session, aged) |
| `documentation_gaps` | Under-documentation — sessions with real work but no decision, stub files, briefs missing required sections |
| `dangling_scopes` | Brief `MILESTONES`/`OPEN QUESTIONS` items whose terms never appear in any session |

The last three revive the original `/dream`'s content checks (see *Lineage* below). Each entry carries enough context (`file`, `line`, `excerpt`/`shared_terms`) for Claude to judge without re-reading every file. `meta.summary` gives per-category counts.

Claude reads the JSON, renders a content-state narrative, and judges each candidate before planning.

## Phase 2 — Judge

For each candidate, Claude reads the cited prose and decides:
- **staleness** → is the content actually outdated, or just old-but-correct?
- **supersession** → does the newer decision truly overrule the older? If so, the older needs a `superseded` marker.
- **contradiction** → real conflict, or two compatible statements that merely share vocabulary?
- **redundancy** → consolidate into one note, or are the duplicates intentionally distinct?
- **stale_refs** → repoint, archive, or leave?
- **orphan_questions / orphan_threads** → still open (re-surface), resolved-elsewhere (close), or archive?
- **unacted_decisions** → was the consequence actually implemented (mark `status: implemented`), still pending (leave / re-surface), or abandoned (mark `reversed`)?
- **documentation_gaps** → real gap worth backfilling, or intentionally terse?
- **dangling_scopes** → still planned (keep), silently done (record it), or dropped (strike from brief)?

Discard false positives here. The catalog is deliberately generous — Phase 2 is where it gets cut down to truth.

## Phase 3 — Write the refresh plan

Invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` to produce a concrete content-refresh plan, and mirror it into a `dream-report` (see `templates/dream-report.md`) written to the project's `dreams/` folder as `{YYYY-MM-DD}-dream.md`:
- Decisions to mark `superseded` (with the superseding file)
- Note/doc consolidations (which files merge into which canonical target; which get archived)
- Sessions to archive (move to `_archive/`)
- Orphan threads to close or re-surface (as a fresh open question / decision)
- Stale refs to repoint or remove
- Plus any mechanical fixes spun off to `tidy`

Plan written under `iterations/{YYYY-MM-DD}-iter-{id}-dream/` per the iteration-shelf convention.

## Phase 4 — Human review

User reviews the plan. May approve as-is, edit specific entries, reject and re-judge, or defer specific items (e.g., "archive the 2024 sessions in a separate pass").

## Phase 5 — Execute

Invoke `superpowers:executing-plans` to apply with checkpoints. Each plan step is its own commit-able unit. **Content operations are destructive — every one is backed up first** to `.adjudant-dream-backup/{ISO-8601-Z-timestamp}/<rel_path>.legacy` before the live edit. A `.adjudant-dream-{ts}/` workspace dir holds the plan + checkpoint state. For mechanical follow-up (index rebuilds after a consolidation, tag normalisation), call `tidy.py preview` then `tidy.py apply`.

## Inputs

Default: current project (resolved from the `.claude/adjudant` breadcrumb — `dream.py` auto-follows it, same as the other helpers). Vault-wide dream means a deliberate per-project loop; not a single invocation.

## Fail conditions

- No vault resolvable → stale-ref resolution is skipped (other detectors still run); the scan never hard-fails on a missing vault
- `dream.py` exits non-zero → halt before phase 2
- User aborts during phase 4 → leave `.adjudant-dream-{ts}/` for resume; no live changes
- Phase 5 partial failure → halt at last checkpoint, leave `.adjudant-dream-backup/` for rollback

## Lineage — the original `/dream`

This verb's content checks descend from an earlier `/dream` (its historical two-pass design is preserved in `docs/superpowers/2026-04-30-obsidian-bridge.design.md` §13): a structural-sanitation pass — now split across `tidy` + `ramasse` — and a content-analysis pass (contradictions, stale info, dangling scopes, unacted decisions, documentation gaps). adjudant `dream` is that content pass, modernised into a read-only comparator catalog. **It is fully standalone** — it has no dependency on, and no interoperation with, any other plugin; the report is always dry, with no personality layer.

## When NOT to use dream

- For routine surface cleanup: use `/adjudant tidy`
- For folder/schema/naming restructure: use `/adjudant ramasse`
- For a single obviously-superseded decision: just add the `superseded` marker manually
