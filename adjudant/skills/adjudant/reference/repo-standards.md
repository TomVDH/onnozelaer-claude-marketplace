# Repo standards

Single source of truth for **code-repo** conventions — the counterpart to
`vault-standards.md`, which governs the vault. These are the categories the
`check repo` / `tidy repo` target audits and (safely) repairs. The general core
applies to any connected repo; the marketplace layer auto-activates when a
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is present at the repo root.

## General core (any repo)

### Context files

The repo root carries `AGENTS.md` (canonical, harness-agnostic project context)
and `CLAUDE.md`. `CLAUDE.md`'s first non-empty line must be `@AGENTS.md` — it
imports AGENTS rather than duplicating it. Per-plugin `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` are
optional at this repo's scale; their absence is reported *informational*, never
counted as drift.

### Plan age

Design/plan docs live under `docs/superpowers/`. A doc with no completion marker
(`status: done`, `status: complete`, `status: shipped`, or a ✅ near the top)
that is older than the staleness threshold (default 30 days by mtime) is flagged
as a stale plan. The fix is to mark it complete or archive it — an archival move
is deliberate structural work (`ramasse`-tier), not a `tidy` fix.

## Marketplace layer (marketplace.json present)

### Version coherence

Every plugin listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` must declare the same
`version` as its own `<source>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is already
gated at commit time by `scripts/check_marketplace_versions.py`; `check repo`
surfaces the same signal read-only and never "fixes" it (the pre-commit gate
owns repair by blocking drift). Use `python3 scripts/bump_plugin_version.py
<plugin> <X.Y.Z>` to move a version — never hand-edit.

### Symlink integrity

The Impeccable pattern: a plugin's real skill content lives at
`<plugin>/skills/<name>/`, and the three harness dirs mirror it via **relative
symlinks** — `<plugin>/source/skills/<name>`, `<plugin>/.claude/skills/<name>`,
and `<plugin>/.gemini/skills/<name>` each resolve to `../../skills/<name>`. A
plugin is *harness-adopted* when its canonical skill dir exists and at least one
of the three symlinks is present. `tidy repo` repairs a missing or dangling
symlink on an adopted plugin; it never creates a harness for a plugin that has
none (auto-adoption is `ramasse`-tier, deferred). A plugin with no `skills/` dir
needs no harness and is not flagged.

### Registration

Every plugin directory at the repo root (one carrying
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) must be registered in `marketplace.json`, and
every registered `source` path must resolve to an existing directory. An
unregistered plugin or a dangling `source` path is drift.

## What the repo target does NOT touch

- **No content/prose cleanup** — that is the vault's `dream` tier, vault-only.
- **No regex drift-defense** (whitespace, secrets, deprecated tags) — hookify
  owns that.
- **No auto-adoption or archival in `tidy`** — structural moves are deferred
  `ramasse` work.
