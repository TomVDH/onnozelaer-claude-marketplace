"""PostCompact hook for adjudant.

MECHANICAL ONLY, no model calls. One cheap job: after the harness compacts
the conversation, append the compaction gist to today's vault session log:

    - HH:MM · compacted: <summary, single line, first 160 chars>

PreCompact keeps writing the pause tombstone; this hook adds the content the
markers-only log was missing. The summary rides in on stdin JSON: the probe
on this Claude Code version confirmed the `compaction_summary` field, and
documented fallback keys (`summary`, `compact_summary`, `message`) are tried
in order for older or future payload shapes. An empty or missing summary
writes nothing (gate on real signal). All vault I/O fails closed: a stale
breadcrumb or offline vault must never crash the hook, and the hook never
creates a session note (that is SessionStart's job).
