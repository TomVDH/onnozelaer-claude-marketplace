"""PreCompact hook for adjudant.

MECHANICAL ONLY — no model calls. Must finish well inside the 5s hook budget.
Two lanes, both cheap on-disk reads:

  1. Append an enriched pause tombstone to today's vault session log:
       `- HH:MM · paused (compaction) · next: <NEXT line>`
  2. Mirror `.remember/remember.md` (or `now.md`) → vault `_handoff.md`, with a
     freshness header (traffic light · age · NEXT · stale flag).

SessionEnd reuses this with `--sync-only` (no pause marker).

Freshness logic is shared with `/adjudant sync` via `scripts/_handoff_freshness.py`
(single source of truth). The import is best-effort: if it ever fails, the hook
still does its mechanical work — it just omits the freshness header. All vault
I/O fails closed: an offline iCloud vault must never crash the compaction.
